## Notes

### [Stablecoins 2.0: Economic Foundations and Risk-based Models](https://berkeley-defi.github.io/assets/material/Stablecoins%202.0%20.pdf)

![risk based overview of stable coin design space](/post-assets/stablecoin-design/stablecoiin-design-space.png)

> Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with an added economic structre that aims to stablize their price and purchasing power. There are two classes of stablecoin: custodial, which require trust in a third party, and non-custodial, which replace this trust with economic mechanisms.

1. Risk basesd functional characterization of the economic structures of stable coins
2. Different ways to categorization:
   a. collateral used
   b. peg target
   c. technological mechanisms (e.g. on chain, off-chain, algorithmic)

> As the term "stablecoin" spread, its meaning started to blur. This is problematic. An unclear definition may make us susceptible to deceptive innovation, that is, reintroducing existing services but in a different appearance. We ought to ask ourselves: are stablecoins here to stay or are they simply old wine in new bottles?
